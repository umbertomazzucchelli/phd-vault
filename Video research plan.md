# Project Description: Advanced Video Annotation System Using VideoLLaMA 2 and Ego4D
## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced video annotation system that combines scene change detection with multimodal large language models to automatically generate rich annotations for egocentric videos. By leveraging VideoLLaMA 2's video understanding capabilities and the task framework from Ego4D, we'll create a system that can detect when scenes change in videos and generate comprehensive annotations across multiple dimensions of human-human and human-object interactions.
## Core Components

### 1. Scene Change Detection Module

The scene change detection module will analyze video streams to identify significant transitions between scenes or activities. This will serve as the trigger for segmenting the video into meaningful chunks.

**Approaches to explore:**
- Traditional computer vision techniques (frame differencing, histogram comparison)
- Deep learning-based approaches (CNN-based scene boundary detection)
- Transformer-based temporal understanding models

**Key papers to review:**
- "TransNetV2: Shot Boundary Detection Neural Network" (Souček & Lokoč, 2020)
- "SCID: Scene Change and Identity Detection" (Donato et al., 2021)
- "Shot Boundary Detection via Temporal MultiScale Transformer" (Tang et al., 2022)

### 2. Video Chunking and Processing Pipeline

This component will handle the segmentation of videos based on detected scene changes and prepare these segments for annotation.

**Key features:**
- Dynamic thresholding for scene change sensitivity
- Temporal smoothing to avoid over-segmentation
- Buffer handling for context preservation across scene boundaries
- Parallel processing architecture for handling multiple video chunks

### 3. VideoLLaMA 2 Integration

VideoLLaMA 2 will serve as the core annotation engine, leveraging its capabilities for understanding spatial-temporal relationships in video content.

**Integration considerations:**
- Model selection (7B vs 8x7B vs 72B variants)
- Prompt engineering specific to the Ego4D tasks
- Processing optimization for real-time or near-real-time annotation
- Fine-tuning strategies on Ego4D data

### 4. Task-Specific Annotation Framework

Based on the seven diverse Ego4D tasks, we'll develop a structured annotation framework:

**Human-Human Interaction (HHI) Tasks:**
1. **Looking At Me (LAM)** - Detect faces looking at the camera wearer
2. **Talking To Me (TTM)** - Identify faces talking to the camera wearer
3. **Active Speaker Detection (ASD)** - Detect speaking persons in video-audio pairs

**Human-Object Interaction (HOI) Tasks:** 4. **Point-of-no-return Keyframe Localization (PNR)** - Identify critical state change moments 5. **Object State Change Classification (OSCC)** - Detect object state changes 6. **Action Recognition (AR)** - Classify camera wearer actions (verb + noun) 7. **Long-term Action Anticipation (LTA)** - Predict future action sequences

### Data Flow

1. Input video is processed frame-by-frame through the scene detector
2. When scene changes are detected, the video is chunked
3. Chunks are processed by VideoLLaMA 2 with task-specific prompts
4. Annotations are aggregated, structured, and stored
